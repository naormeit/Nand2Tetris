# Nand2Tetris

Welcome to the **Nand2Tetris** repository! This repository contains all the materials and resources for the **Nand2Tetris** course, which teaches you how to build a computer from scratch.

## Overview

The course covers the construction of a fully functional computer system, from the ground up, using basic logic gates. You will learn how to design hardware, write low-level machine code, and ultimately create a simple operating system and a virtual machine.

Through hands-on projects, you will:

- Design logic gates and circuits using NAND gates.
- Build an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), CPU, and memory system.
- Implement a basic operating system, virtual machine, and compiler.
- Learn the fundamentals of assembly programming and machine-level operations.

## Projects

The course is divided into several key projects:

1. **Project 1 - Logic Gates**: Build and simulate the basic gates like AND, OR, XOR, and NOT using only NAND gates.
2. **Project 2 - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**: Design the ALU and integrate it with the rest of the system.
3. **Project 3 - CPU Design**: Construct a CPU using your ALU, memory, and control units.
4. **Project 4 - Computer Architecture**: Assemble a complete computer with memory and CPU.
5. **Project 5 - Operating System and VM**: Implement a basic operating system and write a compiler.
